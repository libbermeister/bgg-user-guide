                <h3>How to Search for a Specific Game</h3>
                <p>When looking for a game by its name, the easiest way to do so is using the search field in the navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>
                <img src="img/search/search_field.png">
                <p>Once you start typing, you will see some name suggestions, as well as some other search criteria. You can either click on the game in the suggestion list, or continue to type out the whole name, and then press Enter (or its equivalent on mobile).</p>
                <img src="img/guides/game_search/search_suggestions.png">
                <p>After you've selected the game, you will be brought to a page that shows all the details about it. If you are unfamiliar with a game detail screen, check out <a href="game_details.html">this guide</a> to learn more about all the cool tidbits on these pages.</p>
                
                <h3>Discovering New or Different Games</h3>
